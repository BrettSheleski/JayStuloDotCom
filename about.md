# Jay Stulo

Jay Stulo has been playing, fronting, and leading blues bands since the late 1980’s. He has toured the nation several times and released 5 CD's. Jay first picked up guitar at the age of 14, learning some basic chords from his father, a early rock-a-billy guitarist. He joined his first working bar band **Gypsy Rose** at the age of 17. 

Jay hit the road early with blues legend **Luther Allison**, then later with **James Solberg**. Jay co-founded The **Mighty Aces** in 1996 and toured full-time for a decade leading the **The Jay Stulo Band**. After taking some time away from music in 2006, Jay picked up his guitar returned to the stage in 2016. It did not take long to get back on top of his game, first as part of the West Coast style **Jay Edward Band** and now leading an all new **Jay Stulo Band**. 

Influenced by multiple genres, Jay is not a traditional blues artist by any means, and this is not your grandfather’s blues - versatile, high energy guitar pyrotechnics, rock-tinged hooks, and gut-bucket vocals make for a show to remember.
